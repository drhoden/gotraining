Go is a computer language that focuses on simplicity and efficient toolings. 

It aims to provide _frictionless_ application development experience.

## Installation

The side benefit of understanding the installation steps is to become more familiar with your local filesystem.

## Basic Syntax

It is helpful to be aware of the following samples, not to dwell too long in it, but rather keep revisiting as needed.

- https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1

## Basic Project Structure

We (should) use someone else's code more often than writing our own. Go-module structure is the industry standard for Go code-sharing.

## CLI (command line interface)

Command-line-interface is the most basic (and common) form of application. Cobra/Viper is a popular library for building CLI.

## Git

Successful software development is rarely accomplished alone. GIT is an important SVC tool (yet another CLI :) to help facilitate development process for multiple individuals.
